# Code sign a file

## Inputs

### `certificate`

**Required** The base64 encoded certificate.

### `folder`

**Required** The folder that contains the libraries to sign.

### `recursive`

**Optional** Recursively search for DLL files.

### `password`

**Optional** Certificate password.

## Example usage

```yaml
runs-on: windows-latest

  with:
    certificate: '${{ secrets.CERTIFICATE }}'
    folder: 'files'
    recursive: true
    password: '${{ secrets.CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD }}'
```
